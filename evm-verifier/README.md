# @ensdomains/evm-verifier
A Solidity library that verifies state proofs generated by an [evm-gateway](../evm-gateway/) instance. This library implements all the functionality required make CCIP-Read calls to an EVM gateway and verify the responses, except for verifying the root of the proof. This library is intended to be used by libraries for specific EVM-compatible chains that implement the missing  functionality.
