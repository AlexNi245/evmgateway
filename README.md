# EVM CCIP-Read Gateway
This repository implements a generic CCIP-Read gateway framework for fetching state proofs of data on other EVM chains.

## Usage

 1. Have your contract extend `EVMFetcher`.
 2. In a view/pure context, use `EVMFetcher` to fetch the value of slots from another contract (potentially on another chain). Calling `EVMFetcher.fetch()` terminates execution and generates a callback to the same contract on a function you specify.
 3. In the callback function, use the information from the relevant slots as you see fit.

## Example

The example below fetches its own storage value `testUint` in the most byzantine possible manner.

```

import { EVMFetcher } from '@ensdomains/evm-verifier/contracts/EVMFetcher.sol';
import { EVMFetchTarget } from '@ensdomains/evm-verifier/contracts/EVMFetchTarget.sol';
import { IEVMVerifier } from '@ensdomains/evm-verifier/contracts/IEVMVerifier.sol';

contract TestTarget is EVMFetchTarget {
    using EVMFetcher for EVMFetcher.EVMFetchRequest;
    
    IEVMVerifier verifier;      // Slot 0
    uint256 testUint;           // Slot 1

    constructor(IEVMVerifier _verifier) {
        verifier = _verifier;
        testUint = 42;
    }

    function getTestUint() public view returns(uint256) {
        EVMFetcher.newFetchRequest(1, verifier, address(this))
            .getStatic(1, 1)
            .fetch(this.getLatestCallback.selector, "");
    }

    function getSingleStorageSlotCallback(bytes[] memory values, bytes memory) public pure returns(uint256) {
        return uint256(bytes32(values[0]));
    }
}
```

## Packages

This is a monorepo divided up into several packages:

### [evm-gateway](/evm-gateway/)
A framework for constructing generic CCIP-Read gateways targeting different EVM-compatible chains. This repository
implements all the functionality required to fetch and verify multiple storage slots from an EVM-compatible chain,
omitting only the L2-specific logic of determining a block to target, and verifying the root of the generated proof.

### [l1-gateway](/l1-gateway/)
An instantiation of `evm-gateway` that targets Ethereum L1 - that is, it implements a CCIP-Read gateway that generates
proofs of contract state on L1.

This may at first seem useless, but as the simplest possible practical EVM gateway implementation, it acts as an excellent
target for testing the entire framework end-to-end.

It may also prove useful for contracts that wish to trustlessly establish the content of storage variables of other contracts,
or historic values for storage variables of any contract.

### [evm-verifier](/evm-verifier/)
A Solidity library that verifies state proofs generated by an `evm-gateway` instance. This library implements all the
functionality required make CCIP-Read calls to an EVM gateway and verify the responses, except for verifying the root of the
proof. This library is intended to be used by libraries for specific EVM-compatible chains that implement the missing 
functionality.

### [l1-verifier](/l1-verifier/)
A complete Solidity library that facilitates sending CCIP-Read requests for L1 state, and verifying the responses.

This repository also contains the end-to-end tests for the entire stack.
